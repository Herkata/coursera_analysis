# Coursera Course Dataset Analysis

## Overview

This project involves analyzing the Coursera Course Dataset sourced from Kaggle. The goal is to apply data analysis and visualization techniques to explore the dataset, uncover insights, and test hypotheses iteratively. The analysis focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, and meaningful visualizations.

## Objectives

- Work with real-world data from an online course platform.
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis to identify trends and patterns.
- Visualize data effectively using Plotly for interactive charts.
- Communicate findings clearly with explanations and insights.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information about Coursera courses, including metadata such as course titles, categories, instructors, ratings, and enrollment details.

## Analysis Approach

- Data loading and cleaning using Pandas.
- Filtering and querying to refine data quality.
- Hypothesis-driven exploration to understand key aspects of course offerings.
- Interactive visualizations created with Plotly to illustrate insights.
- Clear narrative throughout the notebook to explain objectives, findings, and interpretations.

## How to View the Visualizations

This project uses Plotly for interactive visualizations, which display best in a Jupyter Notebook environment. For the best experience, view the notebook on [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/) using the notebook file provided.

## Suggestions for Improvement

- Incorporate additional external data sources for richer context.
- Apply advanced statistical analysis or machine learning models for deeper insights.
- Expand visualizations with dashboards for dynamic filtering and comparison.
- Automate parts of the data cleaning and EDA process for scalability.

## Code Quality and Performance

- The code follows best practices for readability, modularity, and efficiency.
- Comments and markdown cells provide clear explanations of methods and rationale.
- Unused or commented-out code has been removed for clarity.
- Visualization aesthetics adhere to principles of clarity and proportionality.
